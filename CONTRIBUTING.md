# Contributing
Thank you for expressing interest in improving ldr_tools_blender! This document outlines some basic guidelines for how to effectively contribute to this repository.

## Issues
Issues are a way to request features or report bugs. Even if you have no coding experience, reporting issues is still a valuable way to contribute to development by identifying potential problems and suggesting new features and improvements. 

Bug reports should state what's happening, why you think this is unexpected, and provide additional context like the version of the parts library you are using, your operating system, etc. Uploading a file is also very helpful for reproducing issues. 

Features suggestions should describe the feature, explain why it's relevant, and provide additional information like images or links to similar features in other programs.

This project consists of many different open source components. Please post all issues related to using this addon on this repository. When creating an issue, I'll try and identify which components are affected. Some components require knowledge of Rust code and may not be as beginner friendly as the Python code.

## Pull Requests
If you plan on making a pull request with non trivial changes, please make an issue first if there is not one already. Indicate on the issue that you plan on working on implementing the necessary changes. I'll get back to you when I'm available to give feedback. It's important to make an issue first so I can help outline the needed changes as well as the affected projects. It's also possible that someone is already working on implementing it.

Pull requests should generally be small to make them easier to review. Pull requests that affect many files will still be reviewed, but the process will take longer. It's ok if the code has a few bugs. Please say if there's anything you may be stuck on. This provides an opportunity for myself and others to brainstorm solutions.
